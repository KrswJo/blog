This enables developers to create modular applications consisting of loosely coupled components that are ideal for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/microservices\" target=\"_blank\">microservices</a>&nbsp;and distributed network applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring Framework also offers built-in support for typical tasks that an application needs to perform, such as data binding, type conversion, validation, exception handling, resource and event management, internationalization, and more. It integrates with various Java EE technologies such as RMI (Remote Method Invocation), AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), Java Web Services, and others. In sum, Spring Framework provides developers with all the tools and features the need to create loosely coupled, cross-platform Java EE applications that run in any environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Spring Boot adds to Spring Framework</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As capable and comprehensive as Spring Framework is, it still requires significant time and knowledge to configure, set up, and deploy Spring applications. Spring Boot mitigates this effort with three important capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Autoconfiguration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Autoconfiguration means that applications are initialized with pre-set dependencies that you don&#39;t have to configure manually. As Java Spring Boot comes with built-in autoconfiguration capabilities, it automatically configures both the underlying Spring Framework and third-party packages based on your settings (and based on best practices, which helps avoid errors). Even though you can override these defaults once the initialization is complete, Java Spring Boot&#39;s autoconfiguration feature enables you to start developing your Spring-based applications fast and reduces the possibility of human errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Opinionated approach</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring Boot uses an opinionated approach to adding and configuring starter dependencies, based on the needs of your project. Following its own judgment, Spring Boot chooses which packages to install and which default values to use, rather than requiring you to make all those decisions yourself and set up everything manually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can define the needs of your project during the initialization process, during which you choose among multiple starter dependencies&mdash;called&nbsp;<em>Spring Starters</em>&mdash;that cover typical use cases. You run Spring Boot Initializr by filling out a simple web form, without any coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the &lsquo;Spring Web&rsquo; starter dependency allows you to build Spring-based web applications with minimal configuration by adding all the necessary dependencies&mdash;such as the Apache Tomcat web server&mdash;to your project. &lsquo;Spring Security&rsquo; is another popular starter dependency that automatically adds authentication and access-control features to your application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring Boot includes over 50 Spring Starters, and many more third-party starters are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Standalone applications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring Boot helps developers create applications that&nbsp;<em>just run</em>. Specifically, it lets you create standalone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server, by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process. As a result, you can launch your application on any platform by simply hitting the Run command. (You can opt out of this feature to build applications without an embedded Web server.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spring Boot vs. Spring Framework</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, the biggest advantages of using Spring Boot versus Spring Framework alone are ease of use and faster development. In theory, this comes at the expense of the greater flexibility you get from working directly with Spring Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, in practice, unless you need or want to implement a very unique configuration, using Spring Booth is worth the tradeoff. You still are able to use Spring Framework&rsquo;s very popular annotation system that lets you easily inject extra dependencies (not covered by Spring Starters) into your application. And, you still get access to all Spring Framework features, including easy event handling, validation, data binding, type conversion, and built-in security and testing capabilities. Bottom line, if your project&rsquo;s scope is covered by even just one Spring Starter, Spring Boot can significantly streamline development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spring Boot tutorials</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for fast, easy, entry-level Spring Boot instruction, you&rsquo;re in luck.

It looks at your classpath and at the beans you have configured, makes reasonable assumptions about what you are missing, and adds those items. With Spring Boot, you can focus more on business features and less on infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following examples show what Spring Boot can do for you:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Is Spring MVC on the classpath? There are several specific beans you almost always need, and Spring Boot adds them automatically. A Spring MVC application also needs a servlet container, so Spring Boot automatically configures embedded Tomcat.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Is Jetty on the classpath? If so, you probably do NOT want Tomcat but instead want embedded Jetty. Spring Boot handles that for you.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Is Thymeleaf on the classpath? If so, there are a few beans that must always be added to your application context. Spring Boot adds them for you.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just a few examples of the automatic configuration Spring Boot provides. At the same time, Spring Boot does not get in your way. For example, if Thymeleaf is on your path, Spring Boot automatically adds a&nbsp;<code>SpringTemplateEngine</code>&nbsp;to your application context. But if you define your own&nbsp;<code>SpringTemplateEngine</code>&nbsp;with your own settings, Spring Boot does not add one. This leaves you in control with little effort on your part.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>Spring Boot does not generate code or make edits to your files.

When invoked from a browser or by using curl on the command line, the method returns pure text. That is because&nbsp;<code>@RestController</code>&nbsp;combines&nbsp;<code>@Controller</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>@ResponseBody</code>, two annotations that results in web requests returning data rather than a view.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Create an Application class</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spring Initializr creates a simple application class for you. However, in this case, it is too simple. You need to modify the application class to match the following listing (from&nbsp;<code>src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java</code>):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>package com.example.springboot;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\r\n\r\n@SpringBootApplication\r\npublic class Application {\r\n\r\n	public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);\r\n	}\r\n\r\n	@Bean\r\n	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(ApplicationContext ctx) {\r\n		return args -&gt; {\r\n\r\n			System.out.println(&quot;Let&#39;s inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:&quot;);\r\n\r\n			String[] beanNames = ctx.getBeanDefinitionNames();\r\n			Arrays.sort(beanNames);\r\n			for (String beanName : beanNames) {\r\n				System.out.println(beanName);\r\n			}\r\n\r\n		};\r\n	}\r\n\r\n}</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><code>@SpringBootApplication</code>&nbsp;is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><code>@Configuration</code>: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><code>@EnableAutoConfiguration</code>: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if&nbsp;<code>spring-webmvc</code>&nbsp;is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a&nbsp;<code>DispatcherServlet</code>.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><code>@ComponentScan</code>: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the&nbsp;<code>com/example</code>&nbsp;package, letting it find the controllers.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<code>main()</code>&nbsp;method uses Spring Boot&rsquo;s&nbsp;<code>SpringApplication.run()</code>&nbsp;method to launch an application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no&nbsp;<code>web.xml</code>&nbsp;file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a&nbsp;<code>CommandLineRunner</code>&nbsp;method marked as a&nbsp;<code>@Bean</code>, and this runs on start up. It retrieves all the beans that were created by your application or that were automatically added by Spring Boot. It sorts them and prints them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Run the Application</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To run the application, run the following command in a terminal window (in the&nbsp;<code>complete</code>) directory:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n./gradlew bootRun</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the&nbsp;<code>complete</code>) directory:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n./mvnw spring-boot:run</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You should see output similar to the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>Let&#39;s inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:\r\napplication\r\nbeanNameHandlerMapping\r\ndefaultServletHandlerMapping\r\ndispatcherServlet\r\nembeddedServletContainerCustomizerBeanPostProcessor\r\nhandlerExceptionResolver\r\nhelloController\r\nhttpRequestHandlerAdapter\r\nmessageSource\r\nmvcContentNegotiationManager\r\nmvcConversionService\r\nmvcValidator\r\norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.MessageSourceAutoConfiguration\r\norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.PropertyPlaceholderAutoConfiguration\r\norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration\r\norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration$DispatcherServletConfiguration\r\norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration$EmbeddedTomcat\r\norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration\r\norg.springframework.boot.context.embedded.properties.ServerProperties\r\norg.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassPostProcessor.enhancedConfigurationProcessor\r\norg.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassPostProcessor.importAwareProcessor\r\norg.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor\r\norg.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor\r\norg.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor\r\norg.springframework.context.annotation.internalRequiredAnnotationProcessor\r\norg.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration\r\npropertySourcesBinder\r\npropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer\r\nrequestMappingHandlerAdapter\r\nrequestMappingHandlerMapping\r\nresourceHandlerMapping\r\nsimpleControllerHandlerAdapter\r\ntomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory\r\nviewControllerHandlerMapping</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You can clearly see&nbsp;<code>org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure</code>&nbsp;beans. There is also a&nbsp;<code>tomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now run the service with curl (in a separate terminal window), by running the following command (shown with its output):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>$ curl localhost:8080\r\nGreetings from Spring Boot!</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add Unit Tests</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You will want to add a test for the endpoint you added, and Spring Test provides some machinery for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Gradle, add the following dependency to your&nbsp;<code>build.gradle</code>&nbsp;file:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>testImplementation(&#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test&#39;)</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Maven, add the following to your&nbsp;<code>pom.xml</code>&nbsp;file:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n	org.springframework.boot\r\n	spring-boot-starter-test\r\n	test\r\n</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now write a simple unit test that mocks the servlet request and response through your endpoint, as the following listing (from&nbsp;<code>src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerTest.java</code>) shows:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>package com.example.springboot;\r\n\r\nimport static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\r\nimport static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;\r\nimport static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;\r\nimport org.springframework.http.MediaType;\r\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;\r\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders;\r\n\r\n@SpringBootTest\r\n@AutoConfigureMockMvc\r\npublic class HelloControllerTest {\r\n\r\n	@Autowired\r\n	private MockMvc mvc;\r\n\r\n	@Test\r\n	public void getHello() throws Exception {\r\n		mvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get(&quot;/&quot;).accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))\r\n				.andExpect(status().isOk())\r\n				.andExpect(content().string(equalTo(&quot;Greetings from Spring Boot!&quot;)));\r\n	}\r\n}</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><code>MockMvc</code>&nbsp;comes from Spring Test and lets you, through a set of convenient builder classes, send HTTP requests into the&nbsp;<code>DispatcherServlet</code>&nbsp;and make assertions about the result. Note the use of&nbsp;<code>@AutoConfigureMockMvc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>@SpringBootTest</code>&nbsp;to inject a&nbsp;<code>MockMvc</code>&nbsp;instance. Having used&nbsp;<code>@SpringBootTest</code>, we are asking for the whole application context to be created. An alternative would be to ask Spring Boot to create only the web layers of the context by using&nbsp;<code>@WebMvcTest</code>. In either case, Spring Boot automatically tries to locate the main application class of your application, but you can override it or narrow it down if you want to build something different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as mocking the HTTP request cycle, you can also use Spring Boot to write a simple full-stack integration test. For example, instead of (or as well as) the mock test shown earlier, we could create the following test (from&nbsp;<code>src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerIT.java</code>):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>package com.example.springboot;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate;\r\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\n@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)\r\npublic class HelloControllerIT {\r\n\r\n	@Autowired\r\n	private TestRestTemplate template;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void getHello() throws Exception {\r\n        ResponseEntity response = template.getForEntity(&quot;/&quot;, String.class);\r\n        assertThat(response.getBody()).isEqualTo(&quot;Greetings from Spring Boot!&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The embedded server starts on a random port because of&nbsp;<code>webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT</code>, and the actual port is configured automatically in the base URL for the&nbsp;<code>TestRestTemplate</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add Production-grade Services</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are building a web site for your business, you probably need to add some management services. Spring Boot provides several such services (such as health, audits, beans, and more) with its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.0/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready\">actuator module</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Gradle, add the following dependency to your&nbsp;<code>build.gradle</code>&nbsp;file:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>implementation &#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator&#39;</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Maven, add the following dependency to your&nbsp;<code>pom.xml</code>&nbsp;file:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n	org.springframework.boot\r\n	spring-boot-starter-actuator\r\n</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Then restart the application. If you use Gradle, run the following command in a terminal window (in the&nbsp;<code>complete</code>&nbsp;directory):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n./gradlew bootRun</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the&nbsp;<code>complete</code>&nbsp;directory):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n./mvnw spring-boot:run</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You should see that a new set of RESTful end points have been added to the application. These are management services provided by Spring Boot. The following listing shows typical output:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>management.endpoint.configprops-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.context.properties.ConfigurationPropertiesReportEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.endpoint.env-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.env.EnvironmentEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.endpoint.health-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.health.HealthEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.endpoint.logfile-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.logging.LogFileWebEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.endpoints.jmx-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.endpoint.jmx.JmxEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.endpoints.web-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.endpoint.web.WebEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.endpoints.web.cors-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.endpoint.web.CorsEndpointProperties\r\nmanagement.health.diskspace-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.system.DiskSpaceHealthIndicatorProperties\r\nmanagement.info-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.info.InfoContributorProperties\r\nmanagement.metrics-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.metrics.MetricsProperties\r\nmanagement.metrics.export.simple-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.metrics.export.simple.SimpleProperties\r\nmanagement.server-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.web.server.ManagementServerProperties</code>COPY</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The actuator exposes the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/actuator/health\">actuator/health</a></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/actuator\">actuator</a></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>There is also an&nbsp;<code>/actuator/shutdown</code>&nbsp;endpoint, but, by default, it is visible only through JMX.

Introduction to the Jakarta Persistence API','<p>As a specification, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338\">Jakarta Persistence API</a>&nbsp;(formerly Java Persistence API) is concerned with&nbsp;<em>persistence</em>, which loosely means any mechanism by which Java objects outlive the application process that created them. Not all Java objects need to be persisted, but most applications persist key business objects. The JPA specification lets you define&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;objects should be persisted, and&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;they are persisted in your Java applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that guide implementers. While JPA&#39;s object-relational mapping (ORM) model was originally based on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hibernate.org/orm/\">Hibernate</a>, it has since evolved. Likewise, while JPA was originally intended for use with relational databases, some JPA implementations have been extended for use with NoSQL datastores. A popular framework that supports JPA with NoSQL is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink\">EclipseLink</a>, the reference implementation for JPA 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3388036/what-is-jdbc-introduction-to-java-database-connectivity.html\">Also on InfoWorld: What is JDBC? Introduction to Java Database Connectivity</a>&nbsp;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core idea behind JPA as opposed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3388036/what-is-jdbc-introduction-to-java-database-connectivity.html\">JDBC</a>, is that for the most part, JPA lets you avoid the need to &ldquo;think relationally.&quot;&nbsp;In JPA, you define your persistence rules in the realm of Java code and objects, whereas JDBC requires you to manually translate from code to relational tables and back again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JPA 3 in Jakarta EE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Java Persistence API was first released as a subset of the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 specification (<a href=\"https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220\">JSR 220</a>) in Java EE 5. It has since evolved as its own spec, starting with the release of JPA 2.0 in Java EE 6 (<a href=\"https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317\">JSR 317</a>). JPA was adopted as an independent project of Jakarta EE in 2019. The current release as of this writing is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jpa\">JPA 3.1</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular JPA implementations like Hibernate and EclipseLink now support JPA 3.&nbsp;Migrating from JPA 2 to JPA 3 involves some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thorben-janssen.com/migrating-jpa-2-x-to-3-0/\">namespace changes</a>, but otherwise the changes are under-the-hood performance gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 second of 28 secondsVolume 0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3379043/what-is-jpa-introduction-to-the-java-persistence-api.html#toc-1\">JPA and Hibernate</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3379043/what-is-jpa-introduction-to-the-java-persistence-api.html#toc-2\">What is Java ORM?</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3379043/what-is-jpa-introduction-to-the-java-persistence-api.html#toc-3\">Data persistence in Java</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3379043/what-is-jpa-introduction-to-the-java-persistence-api.html#toc-4\">Metadata annotations in JPA</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3379043/what-is-jpa-introduction-to-the-java-persistence-api.html#toc-5\">Configuring JPA</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>SHOW MORE&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>JPA and Hibernate</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of their intertwined history, Hibernate and JPA are frequently conflated. However, like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3313114/what-is-a-java-servlet-request-handling-for-java-web-applications.html\">Java Servlet</a>&nbsp;specification, JPA has spawned many compatible tools and frameworks. Hibernate is just one of many JPA tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by Gavin King and first released in early 2002,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.javaworld.com/article/2072999/get-started-with-hibernate.html\">Hibernate</a>&nbsp;is an ORM library for Java. King developed Hibernate as an alternative to entity beans for persistence. The framework was so popular, and so needed at the time, that many of its ideas were adopted and codified in the first JPA specification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hibernate.org/\">Hibernate ORM</a>&nbsp;is one of the most mature JPA implementations, and still a popular option for ORM in Java. The latest release as of this writing,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/\">Hibernate ORM 6</a>, implements JPA 2.2. Additional Hibernate tools include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hibernate.org/search\">Hibernate Search</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hibernate.org/validator/%22\">Hibernate Validator</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hibernate.org/ogm/\">Hibernate OGM</a>, which supports domain-model persistence for NoSQL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>[&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GcB9CY\">REGISTER NOW for CIO 100: Symposium &amp; Awards Conference, August 15-17&nbsp;</a>]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JPA and EJB</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted earlier, JPA was introduced as a subset of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.0, but has since evolved as its own specification.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3432125/what-is-ejb-the-evolution-of-enterprise-javabeans.html\">EJB is a specification with a different focus from JPA</a>, and is implemented in an EJB container. Each EJB container includes a persistence layer, which is defined by the JPA specification.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is Java ORM?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While they differ in execution, every JPA implementation provides some kind of ORM layer. In order to understand JPA and JPA-compatible tools, you need to have a good grasp on ORM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Object-relational mapping is a&nbsp;<em>task</em>&ndash;one that developers have good reason to avoid doing manually. A framework like Hibernate ORM or EclipseLink codifies that task into a library or framework, an&nbsp;<em>ORM layer</em>. As part of the application architecture, the ORM layer is responsible for managing the conversion of software objects to interact with the tables and columns in a relational database. In Java, the ORM layer converts Java classes and objects so that they can be stored and managed in a relational database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By default, the name of the object being persisted becomes the name of the table, and fields become columns. Once the table is set up, each table row corresponds to an object in the application. Object mapping is configurable, but defaults tend to work, and by sticking with defaults, you avoid having to maintain configuration metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JPA with NoSQL</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Until fairly recently, non-relational databases were uncommon curiosities. The NoSQL movement changed all that, and now a variety of NoSQL databases are available to Java developers. Some JPA implementations have evolved to embrace NoSQL, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hibernate.org/ogm/\">Hibernate OGM</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink\">EclipseLink</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1 illustrates the role of JPA and the ORM layer in application development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2022/05/what-is-jpa.drawio-1-100928128-orig.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\"><img alt=\"JPA in the Java ORM layer.\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2022/05/what-is-jpa.drawio-1-100928128-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" style=\"height:275px; width:1200px\" /></a><small>IDG</small></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1. JPA and the Java ORM layer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Configuring the Java ORM layer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you set up a new project to use JPA, you will need to configure the datastore and JPA provider. You&#39;ll configure a&nbsp;<em>datastore connector</em>&nbsp;to connect to your chosen database (SQL or NoSQL). You&#39;ll also include and configure the&nbsp;<em>JPA provider</em>, which is a framework such as Hibernate or EclipseLink. While you can configure JPA manually, many developers choose to use Spring&#39;s out-of-the-box support. We&#39;ll take a look at both manual and Spring-based JPA installation and setup shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Java Data Objects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Java Data Objects (JDO) is a standardized persistence framework that differs from JPA primarily by supporting persistence logic in the object, and by its longstanding support for working with non-relational data stores. JPA and JDO are similar enough that JDO providers frequently also support JPA. See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://db.apache.org/jdo/why_jdo.html\">Apache JDO Project</a>&nbsp;to learn more about JDO in relation to other persistence standards like JPA and JDBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data persistence in Java</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From a programming perspective, the ORM layer is an&nbsp;<em>adapter layer</em>: it adapts the language of object graphs to the language of SQL and relational tables. The ORM layer allows object-oriented developers to build software that persists data without ever leaving the object-oriented paradigm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you use JPA, you create a&nbsp;<em>map</em>&nbsp;from the datastore to your application&#39;s data model objects. Instead of defining how objects are saved and retrieved, you define the mapping between objects and your database, then invoke JPA to persist them. If you&#39;re using a relational database, much of the actual connection between your application code and the database will then be handled by JDBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a specification, JPA provides&nbsp;<em>metadata annotations</em>, which you use to define the mapping between objects and the database. Each JPA implementation provides its own engine for JPA annotations. The JPA spec also provides the&nbsp;<code>PersistanceManager</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>EntityManager</code>, which are the key points of contact with the JPA system (wherein your business logic code tells the system what to do with the mapped objects).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make all of this more concrete, consider Listing 1, which is a simple data class for modeling a musician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 1. A simple data class in Java</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\npublic class Musician {\r\n&nbsp; private Long id;\r\n&nbsp; private String name;\r\n&nbsp; private Instrument mainInstrument;\r\n&nbsp; private ArrayList performances = new ArrayList();\r\n&nbsp; public Musician( Long id, String name){ /* constructor setters... */ }\r\n&nbsp; public void setName(String name){\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.name = name;\r\n&nbsp; }\r\n&nbsp; public String getName(){\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return this.name;\r\n&nbsp; }\r\n&nbsp; public void setMainInstrument(Instrument instr){\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.instrument = instr;\r\n&nbsp; }\r\n&nbsp; public Instrument getMainInstrument(){\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return this.instrument;\r\n&nbsp; }\r\n&nbsp; // ...Other getters and setters...\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class in Listing 1 is used to hold data. It can contain primitive data such as the&nbsp;<em>name</em>&nbsp;field. It can also hold relations to other classes such as&nbsp;<code>mainInstrument</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>performances</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>Musician</code>&#39;s&nbsp;<em>reason for being</em>&nbsp;is to contain data. This type of class is sometimes known as a DTO, or&nbsp;<em>data transfer object</em>. DTOs are a common feature of software development. While they hold many kinds of data, they do not contain any business logic. Persisting data objects is a ubiquitous challenge in software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data persistence with JDBC</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to save an instance of the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class to a relational database would be to use the JDBC library. JDBC is a layer of abstraction that lets an application issue SQL commands without thinking about the underlying database implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 2 shows how you could persist the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class using JDBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 2. JDBC inserting a record</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\nMusician georgeHarrison = new Musician(0, &quot;George Harrison&quot;);\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String myDriver = &quot;org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver&quot;;\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String myUrl = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost/test&quot;;\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class.forName(myDriver);\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(myUrl, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String query = &quot; insert into users (id, name) values (?, ?)&quot;;\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PreparedStatement preparedStmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preparedStmt.setInt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1, 0);\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preparedStmt.setString (2, &quot;George Harrison&quot;);\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preparedStmt.setString (2, &quot;Rubble&quot;);\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preparedStmt.execute();\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conn.close();\r\n// Error handling removed for brevity</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The code in Listing 2 is fairly self-documenting. The&nbsp;<code>georgeHarrison</code>&nbsp;object could come from anywhere (front-end submit, external service, etc.), and has its ID and name fields set. The fields on the object are then used to supply the values of an SQL insert statement. (The&nbsp;<code>PreparedStatement</code>&nbsp;class is part of JDBC, offering a way to safely apply values to an SQL query.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While JDBC provides the control that comes with manual configuration, it is cumbersome compared to JPA. To modify the database, you first need to create an SQL query that maps from your Java object to the tables in a relational database. You then have to modify the SQL whenever an object signature changes. With JDBC, maintaining the SQL becomes a task in itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data persistence with JPA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now consider Listing 3, where we persist the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class using JPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 3. Persisting George Harrison with JPA</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\nMusician georgeHarrison = new Musician(0, &quot;George Harrison&quot;);\r\nmusicianManager.save(georgeHarrison);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 3 replaces the manual SQL from Listing 2 with a single line,&nbsp;<code>entityManager.save()</code>, which instructs JPA to persist the object. From then on, the framework handles the SQL conversion, so you never have to leave the object-oriented paradigm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Metadata annotations in JPA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The magic in Listing 3 is the result of a&nbsp;<em>configuration</em>, which is created using JPA&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javabeat.net/eclipselink-jpa-annotations/\">annotations</a>. Developers use annotations to inform JPA which objects should be persisted, and how they should be persisted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 4 shows the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class with a single JPA annotation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 4. JPA&#39;s @Entity annotation</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class Musician {\r\n&nbsp; // ..class body\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Persistent objects are sometimes called&nbsp;<em>entities</em>. Attaching&nbsp;<code>@Entity</code>&nbsp;to a class like&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;informs JPA that this class and its objects should be persisted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>XML vs. annotation-based configuration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>JPA also lets you use external XML files to define class metadata, instead of annotations. But why would you do that to yourself?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Configuring JPA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most modern frameworks, JPA embraces&nbsp;<em>coding by convention</em>&nbsp;(also known as&nbsp;<em>convention over configuration</em>), in which the framework provides a default configuration based on industry best practices. As one example, a class named&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;would be mapped by default to a database table called Musician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conventional configuration is a timesaver, and in many cases it works well enough. It is also possible to customize your JPA configuration. As an example, you could use JPA&#39;s&nbsp;<code>@Table</code>&nbsp;annotation to specify the table where the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class should be stored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 5. JPA&#39;s @Table annotation</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name=&quot;musician&quot;)\r\npublic class Musician {\r\n&nbsp; // ..class body\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 5 tells JPA to persist the entity (the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;class) to the Musician table.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Primary key</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In JPA, the&nbsp;<em>primary key</em>&nbsp;is the field used to uniquely identify each object in the database. The primary key is useful for referencing and relating objects to other entities. Whenever you store an object in a table, you will also specify the field to use as its primary key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Listing 6, we tell JPA what field to use as&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&#39;s primary key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listing 6. Specifying the primary key</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class Musician {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; @Id\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; private Long id;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, we&#39;ve used JPA&#39;s&nbsp;<code>@Id</code>&nbsp;annotation to specify the&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;field as&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&#39;s primary key. By default, this configuration assumes the primary key will be set by the database--for instance, when the field is set to auto-increment on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPA supports other strategies for generating an object&#39;s primary key. It also has annotations for changing individual field names. In general, JPA is flexible enough to adapt to any persistence mapping you might need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>CRUD operations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&#39;ve mapped a class to a database table and established its primary key, you have everything you need to create, retrieve, delete, and update that class in the database. Calling&nbsp;<code>entityManager.save()</code>&nbsp;will create or update the specified class, depending on whether the primary-key field is null or applies to en existing entity. Calling&nbsp;<code>entityManager.remove()</code>&nbsp;will delete the specified class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3373652/java-persistence-with-jpa-and-hibernate-part-1-entities-and-relationships.html\">Also on InfoWorld: Java persistence with JPA and Hibernate: Entities and relationships</a>&nbsp;]</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Entity relationships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply persisting an object with a primitive field is only half the equation. JPA also lets you manage entities in relation to one another. Four kinds of entity relationships are possible in both tables and objects:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>One-to-many</li>\r\n	<li>Many-to-one</li>\r\n	<li>Many-to-many</li>\r\n	<li>One-to-one</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Each type of relationship describes how an entity relates to other entities. For example, the&nbsp;<code>Musician</code>&nbsp;entity could have a&nbsp;<em>one-to-many relationship</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<code>Performance</code>, an entity represented by a collection such as&nbsp;<code>List</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>Set</code>.</p>\r\n','jw_java_persistence_series_3x2_2400x1600_3_data_center_database_digital_information_blocks_server_traffic_routing_by_ramcreativ_gettyimages-100792562-larg.webp','2022-06-01 14:31:19',19,8,8),(62,'TO BE FE-DEVELOPER','<p><img alt=\"Frontend Developer Roadmap: Learn to become a modern frontend developer\" src=\"https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps/frontend.png\" /></p>\r\n','Front-end-developemtn-1.png','2022-06-01 14:39:19',1,1,1),(63,'TO BE BE-DEVELOPER','<p><img alt=\"WEB DEVELOPER ROADMAP - 웹 개발자 로드맵\" src=\"https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2651994258D54FA422\" /></p>\r\n','backend.png','2022-06-01 14:40:59',1,1,14),(64,'What is MyBatis?','<p>MyBatis is an open source, lightweight, persistence framework.
